Program Description:

- This Java program collects Employee details which include their Name, Age, Gender, State, and the Company in which they are employed. These details are collected using an object of the Scanner class 'scan'.
- The basic Employee details are then printed onto the console. The basic details include the Employee's Name, Age, and Gender. 
- If the Employee inputs 'm' as his/her Gender, then the Gender is printed as 'MALE', else the Gender is printed as 'FEMALE'.
- Lastly, the complete details of the Employee and the preferable work location based on the State is printed. 
- The complete details include all the details that were provided by the Employee.
- The region and the preferable work location for the Employee is decided using a switch case, which has 30 cases, for different States and Union teritories in the country. 
- Also, if the Company in which the Employee is employed is a top MNC, the program prints "The employee works in a Top MNC Company.", else the program prints "The employee is not working in Top MNC Companies.".
- The program ends after printing the basic and the complete details of the Employee.
